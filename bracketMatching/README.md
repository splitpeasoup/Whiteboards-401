### challenge 3
* Classic Stack Problem called ‘bracket matching’

* Write a function called ‘isBalanced’ that accepts a string of left and right brackets and returns true if the brackets are balanced.

* Use a stack
* Push whenever you see and opening Curley brace
* Pop whenever you see a closing curly brace
* If you see a closing Curley brace when the stack is empty, that's an error
