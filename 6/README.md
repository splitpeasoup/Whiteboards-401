### challenge 6
* write a function called `reverse` that takes one integer as a parameter. Returns a new integer with all the digits reversed. Only use common math operations like `+ * ? %`. You may use `Math.floor` to help with rounding.
* Do not use arrays. Do not use strings. You are forbidden. Stay in the land of numbers.

```reverseInt(459); // returns 954```
