### challenge
Write a function called `commonAncestor` that accepts a binary tree and two values.
Search through the tree to find the closest common ancestor to the two values.

```js
               8
              / \
             2   6
                / \
               7   9
                    \
                     5                   

commonAncestor(root, 7, 5) => 6
```
